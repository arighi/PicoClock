= PicoClock =

Super minmalist & lightweight clock widget for Android.

This application has been designed to be lightweight and power efficient (for
example it doesn't wake up the phone when the screen is off).

There is no option, no configuration, just a plain text frame that shows the
current date and time.

== How to build the application in debug-mode ==

These are the steps to build the application in debug-mode and test it on any
Android device.

 - download the latest Android SDK (http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

 - build the application (be sure to replace the path below):
   $ ant -Dsdk.dir=/path/to/android/sdk/root/dir debug

NOTE: instead of always passing the path of the Android SDK from the command
line, you can also store the path into the file local.properties:

   $ echo sdk.dir=/path/to/android/sdk/root/dir > local.properties

 - install the application to the device
   $ adb install bin/PicoClock-debug.apk
